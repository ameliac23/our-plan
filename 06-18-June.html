					<p><span class="hidden">Good afternoon, and welcome to the Downing Street daily coronavirus briefing.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I’m joined today by</span> Baroness <span class="hidden">Dido Harding, the</span> Executive Chair <span class="hidden">of NHS Test and Trace.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Before we start, I want to recognise the sad loss of Dame Vera Lynn. She</span> united us <span class="hidden">in the worst crisis that this country faced. Ever since, she’s inspired us all with the words she will always be associated with: ‘we will meet again’.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We send our condolences to her family and we will all remember her warmly.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The first thing I want to do is take you through the latest data, then talk about progress with NHS Test and Trace and vaccines.
					<p><span class="hidden">First slide please.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The first slide shows that yesterday there were a hundred and thirty six thousand, five hundred and sixteen tests, taking the total to over seven-and-a-quarter million tests in total. There were one thousand two hundred and eighteen positive test results.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">If we go to the next slide, this slide shows the estimated number of people who had COVID-19 in England, this is according to ONS’s survey. As you can see,</span> the number <span class="hidden">has been coming down over time. And this same survey implies around four and a half thousand new cases per day.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Data from hospitals also shows that broad downward direction. There four hundred and ninety admissions with COVID-19 on the fifteenth of June and, as we can see, the number of people on mechanical ventilator beds is three hundred and sixty.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The number of people in hospital continues to come down in almost every region. You can see a very small up-tick in the east of England. But,</span> as you can see from <span class="hidden">the charts, there is some movement in the variation</span> in each of the lines.</p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And</span> the overall movement <span class="hidden">continues to be down. Overall, five thousand, one hundred and ninety three down from five thousand eight hundred and sixty three this time last week.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And the final slide of this group, please. When it comes to the number of people who have sadly died from coronavirus, yesterday the number of deaths reported was one hundred and thirty five, bringing the total to forty two thousand, two hundred and eighty eight. And again, we can</span> see the <span class="hidden">downward trajectory, thankfully, of that number.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And</span> the number <span class="hidden">of a hundred and thirty five is lower than this time last week, but there’s still some way to go.
					<p><span class="hidden">There’s one additional report that’s worth looking at.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Which is that Public Health England today publish their weekly surveillance report which shows that last week, for the first week since mid-March, the number of people who died in this country,</span> in total, from coronavirus <span class="hidden">and anything else, was no higher than is normal at this time of year.</span> So <span class="hidden">that demonstrates that the</span> number of deaths <span class="hidden">is coming right down.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But</span> the battle <span class="hidden">against this virus is not over.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And</span> it’s a battle with many fronts.<span class="hidden"> And </span>there's two areas <span class="hidden">that I want to update you on today.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden"><strong>Vaccines</strong></span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The first is vaccines.</span></p>
					<p>Before I talk about coronavirus vaccines, I just want to mention a very important reminder<span class="hidden"> about other routine vaccines that are there to protect you.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Throughout the crisis we’ve tried to keep the vaccination programme for children going. And that has been largely successful.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But if you, or your child, is invited for a vaccination, like MMR, please make sure you attend. It’s very important we don’t</span> fall behind on the vaccinations for other diseases <span class="hidden">because of this crisis.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">During the pandemic, we have put stringent measures in place to protect people who are getting vaccinations.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And, in</span> the long run, <span class="hidden">the best way to defeat this virus is, of course, the discovery of a vaccine. And, since the start, we have been supporting the most promising projects.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">As of this week, the Imperial vaccine is now</span> in the first phase <span class="hidden">of human clinical trials and AstraZeneca has</span> struck <span class="hidden">a deal for the manufacture of the Oxford vaccine.</span></p>
					<p>They’re starting manufacturing now, even ahead of approval, <span class="hidden">so we can build up</span> a stockpile and be ready, <span class="hidden">should it be clinically approved. Just like with dexamethasone, the treatment which we</span> stockpiled before <span class="hidden">we had the proof it was clinically effective.</span> So we are starting the manufacture <span class="hidden">of the Oxford vaccine now so that it will be ready should the science come off.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Today, we have published</span> the way <span class="hidden">in which we propose to prioritise people for access to a vaccine, as soon as one comes available.
					<p><span class="hidden">Just as we did for testing, we will be guided by the clinical science,</span> prioritising those <span class="hidden">in most need.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I am very grateful to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which has published its interim advice today.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">They recommend priority vaccination for</span> two groups: frontline health and social care workers, and those <span class="hidden">at increased risk of serious disease and death from coronavirus, including, for example, adults over the age of fifty and those with heart and kidney disease.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">As we learn more about the virus, we will continue to take into account which groups may be particularly vulnerable, including for example those from ethnic minority backgrounds.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">So we can protect the most at risk first should a vaccine become available and get this country back on her feet as soon as we possibly can.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden"><strong>Test and Trace</strong></span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Our approach to</span> vaccines is to throw everything at it, as fast as we can, and rigorously <span class="hidden">to test and make sure they are safe before deployment.</span></p>
					<p>This is our approach across the board in fact, including on <span class="hidden">Test and Trace too.</span> That’s the second area <span class="hidden">that I want to focus on today.</span></p>
					<p>Baroness Harding <span class="hidden">will talk through the latest figures from our NHS Test and Trace programme shortly.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Today’s data show a system that is working well and constantly improving. And, remember, that each one of the thousands of people who are now isolating because of the NHS Test and Trace programme and all the work of those involved is someone who would have been innocently going about their</span> daily lives not knowing <span class="hidden">that they were a risk to their community.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And, as you</span> may remember, <span class="hidden">our plan is to</span> complement <span class="hidden">this</span> human <span class="hidden">contact tracing with a contact tracing app. Like other governments around the world,</span> we've been <span class="hidden">working hard on this, and I want to be up-front and open about the challenges that we, and other countries, are facing.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Over the past few weeks, we have rigorously tested our prototype app in the Isle of Wight, and in field trials ‒ and I want to thank everyone who has been involved and all the islanders of the Isle of Wight: the council, who have been brilliant, the local NHS, and Bob Seely, the MP, who has played a real leadership role. Thank you.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Because of this testing, we discovered a technical barrier, that every other country building their own app is also now hitting. We have found that our app works well on Android devices, but Apple’s software prevents iPhones being used effectively for contact tracing, unless you use Apple’s own technology.</span></p>
					<p>After <span class="hidden">we started work on our app, Google and Apple then started work on their own product, and</span> as soon as they did this, we began working on <span class="hidden">both. We kept our options open,</span> in the same way <span class="hidden">as we do with other areas.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And</span> I personally feel, , in this fight, <span class="hidden">more than any other,</span> we must leave no stone unturned. <span class="hidden">So I asked Dido and the NHS ex team to make sure that they worked on both products.</span></p>
					<p>Of course, <span class="hidden">we have been testing Google and Apple’s product too. And as we did this, we have found that it does not estimate distance well enough. Measuring</span> distance of course is mission critical <span class="hidden">to any contact tracing app.</span></p>
					<p>So, as it stands, our app won’t work, because Apple won’t change their system. But it can measure distance.</p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And </span>their app can’t measure distance well enough to a standard that we are<span class="hidden"> satisfied with. Throughout this, for me,</span> what matters is what works. <span class="hidden">Because what works will save lives.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And I will work with anyone,</span> public or private sector, here or overseas, <span class="hidden">to gain any inch of ground against this disease. So we have</span> agreed <span class="hidden">to join forces with Google and Apple, to bring the best bits of both systems together.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We'll share our algorithm and</span> the work that we've done <span class="hidden">on</span> distance calculation <span class="hidden">and combine that with their work, to deliver a new solution.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I have always been optimistic about the contribution technology can make in this battle against coronavirus. Coming together in this way will bring together some of the best minds to find a solution to this global challenge and help to save lives.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">In the meantime, the NHS</span> Test and Trace system, <span class="hidden">based on good, old fashioned human contact tracing, is working well identifying local outbreaks and helping us to control this virus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And I want to ask you all once more:</span> if you get a call <span class="hidden">or message from NHS Test and Trace, the most important thing is please do your bit to protect your community, to protect your loved ones and to protect the NHS and follow those instructions.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I’d</span> now like <span class="hidden">to hand over to Baroness Harding, to take you through the Test and Trace statistics.</span></p>
