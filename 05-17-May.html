					<p><span class="hidden">Good afternoon.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I am joined today by Professor Steve Powis who is National Medical Director of NHS England.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I will shortly be </span>setting<span class="hidden"> out our progress on vaccines but first, I want to update you on the latest data on the coronavirus response.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">2,580,769 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, </span>including<span class="hidden"> 91,206 tests carried out yesterday.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">243,303 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 3,142 cases since yesterday.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Unfortunately, due to technical issues, Northern Ireland have been unable to process any </span>testing<span class="hidden"> data for Pillar 1 today. Today’s daily totals therefore reflect Pillar 1 data for Great Britain only, </span>excluding<span class="hidden"> Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland are </span>looking<span class="hidden"> to resolve this issue as soon as possible and we will update the data when we can.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">10,035 people are in hospital with COVID-19, down (15%) from 11,817 this time last week.
					<p><span class="hidden">And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 34,636 have now died. That’s an increase of 170 fatalities since yesterday.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Our thoughts are very much with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Before </span>talking<span class="hidden"> about the work on vaccines and </span>taking<span class="hidden"> questions, I just want to remind everyone of the details of the next phase of our fight against coronavirus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">First, in order to monitor our progress, we have established a new COVID Alert Level System, with 5 levels, each </span>relating<span class="hidden"> to the level of threat posed by the virus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The alert level is based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases.
					<p><span class="hidden">And in turn, that alert level will determine the level of social </span>distancing<span class="hidden"> measures in place.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The lower the level, the fewer the measures.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The higher the level, the stricter the measures.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Throughout the period of lockdown, which started on March 23, we have been at Level 4.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Thanks to you, people across the country, we have collectively helped to bring the R level down.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And we are now in a position to begin </span>moving<span class="hidden"> to Level 3, in careful steps.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We have set out the first of 3 steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But crucially, whilst </span>avoiding<span class="hidden"> what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">As the Prime Minister announced this week, as part of the first step:</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="hidden">those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about </span>going<span class="hidden"> back to work</span></li>
							<li><span class="hidden">you can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like</span></li>
							<li><span class="hidden">you can meet 1 person outside of your household in an outdoor public place, provided you stay 2 metres apart</span></li>
						</ul>
					<p>Having<span class="hidden"> taken the first step in carefully </span>adjusting<span class="hidden"> some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated what we are </span>asking<span class="hidden"> people to do.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Which is to: Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives.</span></p>
					<p>Staying<span class="hidden"> Alert, for the vast majority of people, still means </span>staying<span class="hidden"> at home as much as possible.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But there are a range of other actions we are </span>advising<span class="hidden"> people to take.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">People should Stay Alert, by:</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li>working<span class="hidden"> from home if you can</span></li>
							<li>limiting<span class="hidden"> contact with other people</span></li>
							<li>keeping<span class="hidden"> distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible</span></li>
							<li>washing<span class="hidden"> your hands regularly</span></li>
							<li>wearing<span class="hidden"> a face </span>covering<span class="hidden"> when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant, for example in some shops and on public transport</span></li>
							<li><span class="hidden">and, if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate
							<p><span class="hidden">Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by </span>keeping<span class="hidden"> the R down and </span>reducing<span class="hidden"> the number of infections.</span></li>
						</ul>
					<p><span class="hidden">This is how we can continue to save lives as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But in order to definitively conquer this disease, we need to find a safe, workable vaccine.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Last month I announced a new Vaccine Taskforce to coordinate the efforts of government, academia and industry in the critical mission to find a vaccine.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I am very proud of how quickly our scientists and researchers have come together in their efforts to develop a vaccine that will combat coronavirus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Their work has meant that 2 of the world’s front-runners to develop a vaccine are right here in the UK – at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The first clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine is </span>progressing<span class="hidden"> well, with all Phase 1 participants </span>having<span class="hidden"> received their vaccine dose on schedule earlier this week.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">They are now </span>being<span class="hidden"> monitored closely by the clinical trial team.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Imperial College are also </span>making<span class="hidden"> good progress, and will be </span>looking<span class="hidden"> to move into clinical trials by mid-June, with larger scale trials planned to begin in October.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">So far the government has invested £47 million in the Oxford and Imperial vaccine programmes.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But today I can announce an additional £84 million of new government </span>funding<span class="hidden"> to help accelerate their work.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">This new money will help mass produce the Oxford vaccine, so that if current clinical trials are successful, we have dosages to start </span>vaccinating<span class="hidden"> the UK population straight away.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The </span>funding<span class="hidden"> will also allow Imperial to launch phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine later this year.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I can also confirm that with government support, Oxford University has finalised a global </span>licensing<span class="hidden"> agreement with AstraZeneca for the commercialisation and </span>manufacturing<span class="hidden"> of the Oxford vaccine.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">This means that, if the vaccine is successful, Astra Zeneca will work to make up to 30 million doses available by September for the UK, as part of an agreement to deliver 100 million doses in total.
					<p><span class="hidden">The UK will be the first to get access.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And we can also ensure that, in addition to </span>supporting<span class="hidden"> people here in the UK, we are able to make the vaccine available to </span>developing<span class="hidden"> countries at the lowest possible cost.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">To further support our domestic </span>manufacturing<span class="hidden"> capability, last month I announced that the government will accelerate </span>building<span class="hidden"> the UK’s first Vaccines </span>Manufacturing<span class="hidden"> Innovation Centre, which is based at Harwell in Oxfordshire.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And today I can announce that we will invest up to a further £93 million in the Centre, </span>ensuring<span class="hidden"> that it opens in summer 2021 - a full 12 months ahead of schedule.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The Centre – which is already under construction - will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as 6 months.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But if, and it is a big “if”, a successful vaccine is available later this year, we will need to be in a position to manufacture it at scale – and quickly.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">So while the Centre is </span>being<span class="hidden"> built, the government will establish a rapid deployment facility thanks to a further investment of £38 million to begin coronavirus vaccine </span>manufacturing<span class="hidden"> at scale from this summer.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">This facility will support efforts to ensure a vaccine is widely available to the UK public as soon as possible.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">In total, the government has now committed over a quarter of a billion pounds towards </span>developing<span class="hidden"> a vaccine in the UK.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But there are no certainties.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">In spite of the tireless effort of our scientists, it is possible that we may never find a successful coronavirus vaccine.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">So we also need to look at other drug treatments and therapeutics for those who get the virus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Treatments that could prevent people </span>progressing<span class="hidden"> to severe illness, or help save lives of those with serious symptoms.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">While there are currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat coronavirus, the government is </span>working<span class="hidden"> with our scientists and medical experts to identify </span>promising<span class="hidden"> candidates.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">This collaborative UK programme, known as the ACCORD (</span>Accelerating<span class="hidden"> COVID-19 Research & Development platform), aims to get an early indication of drug treatments’ effectiveness in </span>treating<span class="hidden"> coronavirus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And today I can report that 6 drugs have now entered initial live clinical trials.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">If positive results are seen, they will advance into larger scale trials.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Our scientists are </span>working<span class="hidden"> tirelessly to develop vaccines and drug treatments.</span></p>
					<p>Condensing<span class="hidden"> work which would usually take years, into months and even weeks.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Their drive and dedication inspires us all.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And with their help, we will overcome coronavirus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Thank you.</span></p>
