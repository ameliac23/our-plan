					<p><span class="redacted">Good afternoon,</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Welcome to the coronavirus press conference from Downing Street.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I’m joined by Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Steve will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus shortly.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">But, first, let me update you on the steps we are taking to defeat it, and the decisions we have taken today.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Our fight against this virus is happening all across the country,</span> in every home, in every community.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Today’s data shows that:</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">460,437 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out across Great Britain, including 21,389 tests carried out yesterday</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">114,217 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 5,526 cases since yesterday</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">17,759 people are currently</span> in hospital <span class="redacted">with coronavirus</span> in Great Britain, <span class="redacted">down from 18,711 yesterday</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 15,464 have now died. That’s an increase of 888 fatalities since yesterday.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">These are heart-breaking losses for every family affected.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Every part of our government, from Whitehall to your local town hall is working together</span> in this national effort.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And nowhere is that clearer than on the front lines</span> in our communities.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And today as Community Secretary I want to provide an update.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Councils are delivering essential supplies to clinically vulnerable people - those we have asked to shield themselves, paying out financial relief to businesses to enable their local economies to weather the storm as much as is possible, ensuring our bins continue to be collected, ensuring that schools remain open for the children of key workers and vulnerable families are kept</span> in regular contact, <span class="redacted">and they are helping rough sleepers off the streets to protect them from the virus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">This effort, alongside the endeavours of all our public servants, is making a difference</span> in this fight.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">But I know it is our responsibility</span> in government <span class="redacted">to make sure that those front-line workers have the resources they need to keep up this essential work.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">At the beginning of this emergency I told local councils that we would give them the resources they need to do the job. And I meant it.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And that is why today I am providing an additional £1.6 billion of new funding to support councils with the pressures they face as they respond to COVID-19.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">This funding takes the total amount given to councils to help them through the pandemic to over £3.2 billion.
					<p><span class="redacted">We are backing councils to ensure vital services such as adult social care, children’s services, support for vulnerable people and waste collection continue despite the increased pressures.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We are also helping councils with inevitable cashflow challenges by deferring £2.6 billion</span> in business <span class="redacted">rates payments to central government and paying them £850 million</span> in social care <span class="redacted">grants up front this month.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Working with councils and charities, we’ve made huge progress</span> in protecting the vulnerable <span class="redacted">during this national emergency.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Our plans to shield the most clinically vulnerable people have progressed well.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Three weeks ago I reported at this press conference that the first government organised boxes of supplies had been delivered by wholesalers to those at highest risk across the country. Today 250,000 have been delivered. The packages include cereal, fruit, tinned goods, teabags, biscuits, toiletries and other essentials.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And this coming week we expect to be delivering 300,000 boxes – all from a standing start just a few weeks ago.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And our call centre is making up to 130,000 calls a day to those who are shielded, to see if they need this service, to see if they still need it or want to move to a priority delivery slot at their local supermarket.</span></p>
					<p>In addition to this, <span class="redacted"> councils are organising their own calls, often led by volunteers, including our 750,000 NHS volunteers,</span> to check in <span class="redacted">and chat with the shielded.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And they have organised their own efforts to support those who may not have one of the clinical conditions to be shielded but are nonetheless vulnerable or isolated. And there are truly extraordinary efforts underway</span> in this regard, in every village, <span class="redacted">parish, town, ward, estate and city<span class="redacted">, the length and breadth of the country.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We have all been humbled by the gestures, large and small, by people across the country to show support for those working so hard to protect the NHS and to save lives. None more so than Captain Tom Moore, who has raised an astonishing £23 million this week for NHS charities.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I can’t think of a more worthy person to be the guest of honour at the opening of the new Nightingale hospital</span> in Harrogate next week <span class="redacted">– also, fittingly, the county of his birth, Yorkshire.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I am sure everyone will join me</span> in thanking Captain Tom <span class="redacted">for his truly heroic effort.
					<p><span class="redacted">I have also been proud of the effort of councils to help vulnerable people</span> in their areas, <span class="redacted">including securing safe accommodation for rough sleepers.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And our plan to protect rough sleepers has resulted</span> in over 90% <span class="redacted">being offered safe accommodation.
					<p><span class="redacted">I want to thank all those who have made this possible, including local councils, charities and other organisations and those continuing to help the small number of people still regrettably on our streets today.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Of course, this is not the end of rough sleeping. And there is a great deal of work to be done and my departments and I will be at the heart of that.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I want to also say something about support for our high streets and local businesses by local councils.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I’m delighted that so many cafes, restaurants and other businesses have taken up the opportunity to switch to offering delivery, takeaway and click and collect services. This expands the supply of food available to people alongside the supermarkets, as well as allowing businesses that would otherwise have closed to remain open and keep paying staff.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">This simple freedom has been taken up by enterprising people the length across the UK. The same enterprising people whose enguinity, sometimes assisted by government</span> in modest ways <span class="redacted">like this, will help us to rebuild our economy.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Councils have worked hard to pay out over £1 billion worth of business grants from government.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">But it’s vital that we all ensure that all eligible businesses get the support that it needs, and I urge councils who have been slower</span> in making progress <span class="redacted">to their accelerate efforts</span> in the days to come.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Let me address two other topics that I know are of concern to people.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Firstly, there have been examples of some parks around the country closing.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">This cannot be right.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">While the virus does not discriminate, we know that the lockdown is much harder for people who don’t have a lot of living space, who don’t have a garden, and who don’t have anywhere for their children to run around.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">People need parks.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">That’s why I have made it clear to councils that all parks must remain open.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">For the health of the nation, people should be able to safely enjoy fresh air and green space.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And, for the health of the nation, people must abide by social distancing rules and not congregate</span> in groups in parks.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Secondly, there have been some reports of mourners being turned away at funerals.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">The tragedy of the death of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, a 13 year old boy from Brixton, was compounded by the fact that his family were unable to attend his funeral.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">That is not right and it shouldn’t have happened.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">For clarity – funerals can go ahead with close family present.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Social distancing measures must be respected, but families must have the opportunity to say a respectful goodbye to those that they love.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We will be publishing more guidance on this shortly. And I’m also asking councils to keep open or indeed reopen cemeteries and graveyards. Not for people</span> to congregate in. <span class="redacted">That must not happen. But for people to make that private visit. To seek solace in a word <span class="redacted">at the grave of someone you have loved. Or to privately lay flowers. There have been times in my life <span class="redacted">when I have needed to do that. I’m certain there are people who need to do it today.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">These are small steps. But small mercies can make a big difference.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And local councils, at their best, can help to make life, even</span> in times like this, <span class="redacted"> more liveable and more humane.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">They represent and can harness the networks of familiarity and loyalty upon which a society is based.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">The sense that we belong together. And that we will stand by each other</span> in a real emergency.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Those relationships can only be built from below, by people, to people,</span> in communities.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">To all the unsung heroes of local councils. For all you are doing for us all.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Thank you.</span></p>
