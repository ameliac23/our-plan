					<p><span class="hidden">Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our daily briefing in the fight against Covid-19.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I am </span>joined<span class="hidden"> today by Professor Steve Powis, Medical Director of NHS England.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I’d like first to </span>update<span class="hidden"> you on the facts about the </span>spread<span class="hidden"> of the coronavirus,</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Then I will outline why it is so critical that we continue to observe the rules on </span>social<span class="hidden"> distancing.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Thirdly, I will explain what we are doing to increase the capacity of the NHS to deal with this disease.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And finally, I want to say something about how we can all work together to </span>defeat<span class="hidden"> this invisible enemy.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">First, the facts as they stand today.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">As of 9am today, a total of 183,190 </span>people<span class="hidden"> have been </span>tested<span class="hidden">, of which 41,903 </span>tested<span class="hidden"> positive.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">15,073 </span>people<span class="hidden"> in England have been admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But the pattern of hospital admissions in England and Wales has regional differences.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">In </span>London<span class="hidden">, the </span>number<span class="hidden"> of admissions fell slightly between the 1st and 2nd of April.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Admissions are </span>steady<span class="hidden"> in Wales.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But in Yorkshire and the North East they have gone up by 35% and in the Midlands, the rate of hospital admissions has gone up by 47%.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">708 </span>people<span class="hidden"> have sadly lost their lives as a </span>result<span class="hidden"> of Covid-19: the highest daily total yet recorded.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And that means that of those hospitalised in the UK, the </span>number<span class="hidden"> who have </span>passed<span class="hidden"> away now </span>totals<span class="hidden"> 4,313.
					<p><span class="hidden">Those numbers emphasise again the importance of maintaining </span>social<span class="hidden"> distancing measures to halt the </span>spread<span class="hidden"> of the disease.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">More than ever, we must ‘stick with it’, as the Prime Minister said in his video message.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Now I know that life under lockdown can be challenging. Some will be tempted, on this sunny weekend, to venture out and about.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But, as the </span>Health<span class="hidden"> Secretary underlined, yesterday, if we relax our adherence to the rules we increase the risk for </span>others<span class="hidden">.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">That’s why it is so important to stay at home. Protect the NHS. And to save lives.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We need to think of those on the frontline, and the sacrifices that they are </span>making<span class="hidden"> for us. As the Chief Nursing Officer for England reminded us yesterday.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Ruth May asked us to remember two NHS </span>nurses<span class="hidden"> who died after contracting Covid-19.</span></p>
					<p>Areema <span class="hidden">Nasreen, who was just 36, and Aimee O’Rourke, aged 39, each had three young children.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">They died while doing everything they could to help the sick and suffering.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We can all best </span>honour<span class="hidden"> them by playing our part in fighting the disease by staying at home and slowing the </span>spread<span class="hidden">.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Seven healthcare professionals have now lost their lives to Covid-19 and we offer our heartfelt condolences to their grieving families - and to the many </span>others<span class="hidden"> mourning the loss of loved ones.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">They include the </span>family<span class="hidden"> of </span>Ismail<span class="hidden"> Mohamed Adbdulwahab, who died aged just 13 in King’s College Hospital in </span>London<span class="hidden">.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">His </span>mother<span class="hidden"> and siblings are showing symptoms of the virus, and they were </span>unable<span class="hidden"> to say their final goodbyes at his funeral. In their despair, the </span>loving<span class="hidden">, dignified tributes from Ismail’s parents are truly haunting.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Our thoughts today are also with the </span>family<span class="hidden"> of the five-year-old child with underlying </span>health<span class="hidden"> conditions who has tragically died.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">So again: you must stay at home, to protect the NHS and to save lives.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Whatever the temptation this weekend </span>please<span class="hidden"> don’t go outside, to the lakes, the beaches or the countryside.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Take pride instead in keeping your own families and communities safe.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The more we restrict contact, the more we slow the </span>spread<span class="hidden"> of the infection – and the more time we have to build capacity in the NHS so that we can treat those who are most in need.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And I want now to outline how we are increasing NHS capacity.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Yesterday we were grateful to HRH the </span>Prince<span class="hidden"> of Wales, himself recently recovered from Coronavirus, for opening the brand new Nightingale Hospital in east </span>London<span class="hidden">, a testament to brilliant teamwork and determined leadership from the NHS.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Two weeks of hard work have transformed a convention hall into a fully-functioning field hospital that can treat 500 COVID-19 patients on ventilators or through oxygenation.
					<p><span class="hidden">New Nightingale hospitals are due to be built in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Belfast, Glasgow, Harrogate, and Manchester.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And given we now know that the Midlands are a particular area of concern, the NHS and the military are accelerating their existing work to transform the National Exhibition </span>Centre<span class="hidden"> in Birmingham into a 2000-bed Nightingale Hospital. I have </span>spoken<span class="hidden"> to the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy </span>Street<span class="hidden">, earlier today and he is doing all he can with the NHS, to accelerate that work.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Of </span>course<span class="hidden">, a critical part of ensuring the NHS is resilient is improving the testing of staff. 10,984 tests were administered yesterday – and as the </span>Health<span class="hidden"> Secretary outlined on Thursday we have a strategy to increase that </span>number<span class="hidden"> to 100,000 a day.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Testing is a critical part of the clinical pathway that we all </span>follow<span class="hidden"> in seeking to </span>reduce<span class="hidden"> the </span>impact<span class="hidden"> of COVID-19.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But the next vital step is appropriate pharmaceutical treatment.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">That is why as the </span>Health<span class="hidden"> Secretary explained clinical </span>trials<span class="hidden"> are now </span>taking<span class="hidden"> place to see if anti-virals which have </span>helped<span class="hidden"> in the fight against HIV, and anti-malarial medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, can reliably </span>reduce<span class="hidden"> the harm the coronavirus inflicts.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The next stage in the clinical pathway is ensuring those patients with impaired lung functions get the </span>oxygen<span class="hidden"> they need – and this is where ventilation comes in.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We have been working to increase the ventilator capacity </span>across<span class="hidden"> the NHS.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Ventilation can be non-invasive and invasive.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Effective non-invasive ventilation can </span>ensure<span class="hidden"> patients do not need to be </span>placed<span class="hidden"> on invasive ventilators – where they are intubated and supported to breathe with machinery which takes </span>oxygen direct<span class="hidden"> into their lungs.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We have secured new non-invasive capacity with the help of UK manufacturers who have </span>worked<span class="hidden"> at pace to develop new technologies. A team from University College </span>London<span class="hidden"> working with Mercedes Benz have produced a new </span>device<span class="hidden"> which has been clinically approved. They produced 215 yesterday, have produced the same </span>number<span class="hidden"> today and tomorrow, </span>rising<span class="hidden"> to 1,000 a day next week.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We are also increasing the capacity of the NHS to </span>deploy<span class="hidden"> invasive ventilation.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We have been </span>buying<span class="hidden"> invasive ventilators from partners </span>abroad<span class="hidden">, including Germany and Switzerland. And today, 300 new ventilators arrived from China. I’d like to thank the Chinese Government for their support in securing that capacity.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And we have developed new sources of </span>supply<span class="hidden"> here in the UK, with existing and modified </span>models<span class="hidden"> being made in greater numbers and new </span>models<span class="hidden"> designed to come on </span>stream<span class="hidden"> soon.
					<p><span class="hidden">The first </span>models<span class="hidden"> which have been </span></span>scaled<span class="hidden"><span class="hidden"> up as part of the Ventilator Challenge will be </span>coming<span class="hidden"> off production lines this weekend.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">More are to come into operation in the </span>coming<span class="hidden"> weeks, subject to </span>safety<span class="hidden"> and regulatory approvals, as part of the Prime Minister’s call to manufacturers to scale up production.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Increasing this production has involved securing supplies of critical components – from lithium ion batteries to flow regulators – from </span>across<span class="hidden"> the globe to assemble here.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The first of the ventilators that the government has ordered from </span>Penlon<span class="hidden">, a medical devices company based in Oxfordshire, will be begin arriving in hospitals this week for final clinical </span>checks<span class="hidden">.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We are grateful to the MOD personnel who will be delivering them, as we are to all the companies who have devoted time, staff and resources to fighting Covid-19.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The first devices from </span>Smiths<span class="hidden"> Group have also been received at MOD Donnington, a military logistics hub in Shropshire: these have been approved by the regulator.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The initial dispatch is the </span>result<span class="hidden"> of </span>scaled<span class="hidden"> up manufacturing of an existing mechanical ventilator </span>design<span class="hidden"> - and we are grateful for the efforts of an industry consortium including GKN Aerospace and Rolls-Royce.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">These ventilators will be distributed to hospitals this week.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And next week, UK production of another ventilator </span>device<span class="hidden"> from the companies Diamedica and </span>Plexus<span class="hidden"> will start at their factory in Kelso, in Scotland. The </span>design<span class="hidden"> is based on an existing product already in use in the NHS.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The more ventilators – invasive and non-invasive – available to the NHS, the more patients can get the care they need when they need it.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But the process of </span>design<span class="hidden">, testing, assembly and manufacture does take time.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We need to make sure these devices are safe and their manufacture scaleable.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The challenges in increasing numbers are formidable – which is why the commitment of the scientists, engineers, designers and civil servants involved in this work is so impressive.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But you don’t need to be a scientist or engineer to help them.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">All you need to do is observe the </span>social<span class="hidden"> distancing guidelines that have been put in place.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The more we all stay at home, and slow the </span>spread<span class="hidden"> of the disease, the more time we buy for more ventilators to come on </span>stream<span class="hidden"> and for the NHS to </span>become<span class="hidden"> more resilient.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Finally, I want to turn to the way in which all parts of our country are </span>coming<span class="hidden"> together to fight this invisible enemy.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Teachers have kept schools open for those who need them – and parents have kept their children at home wherever possible – so we enter the </span>Easter<span class="hidden"> Holiday weeks with </span>school<span class="hidden"> attendance </span>having<span class="hidden"> been </span>around<span class="hidden"> just 2% - ensuring the most vulnerable can be cared for.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">For children eligible for free </span>school<span class="hidden"> meals, vouchers will be available over the holidays to support household incomes.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">But I am conscious more must be done – particularly over the holiday </span>period<span class="hidden"> – to support children at risk and in need, and we will be </span>saying<span class="hidden"> more next week about work in this area.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I also recognise that we are </span>asking<span class="hidden"> a lot of the British </span>people<span class="hidden">.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And we in Government therefore have a responsibility to communicate as clearly as possible.
					<p><span class="hidden">Clear, factual, </span>timely<span class="hidden"> information.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And an </span>honest<span class="hidden"> assessment of the difficulties we all face – as well as </span>proper<span class="hidden"> recognition of the achievements of those on the frontline who are doing so much to fight this disease.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Adapting to this pandemic has meant developing guidance, implementing new policies and co-ordinating efforts </span>across<span class="hidden"> government at an unprecedented pace.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Inevitably, there has therefore been criticism of some government actions.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I recognise that criticism has been designed to challenge the government’s performance and improve to our response. Which is why I welcome it.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Even as we unite in our efforts to </span>defeat<span class="hidden"> the virus we must also recognise that </span>robust<span class="hidden"> scrutiny is to be welcomed – and is the duty of the media.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Which is why we are </span>acting<span class="hidden"> to both share </span>robust<span class="hidden"> information and support our media by investing more in our government information campaign which is being disseminated through the national media and local newspapers and radio.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We will share essential </span>health advice<span class="hidden"> and information on the support packages available from the Chancellor for workers or for businesses.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We will share details of how you can help volunteer to support our NHS or the vulnerable; and also how you can help British farmers by </span>buying<span class="hidden"> more locally-grown products, and we will also list </span>dozens<span class="hidden"> of other ways you can join the national </span>effort<span class="hidden"> against Coronavirus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We are using </span>social<span class="hidden"> media to reach young </span>people<span class="hidden">, some of whom have been more reluctant than </span>others<span class="hidden"> to </span>follow<span class="hidden"> </span>social<span class="hidden"> distancing rules.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And in this </span>united<span class="hidden"> national </span>effort<span class="hidden">, where we need both constructive challenge and a </span>shared<span class="hidden"> </span>spirit<span class="hidden"> of national endeavour, we want to make sure that we all work collaboratively to help </span>defeat<span class="hidden"> the virus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">That is why we have been co-ordinating daily with our colleague in the devolved administrations, why I spoke yesterday to my friends in the trade union movement Frances O’Grady and Len McCluskey and why the Prime Minister has written today to the leaders of all opposition parties, including the new </span>leader<span class="hidden"> of the </span>Labour<span class="hidden"> Party, Sir Keir Starmer.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I would like to congratulate Sir Keir on his victory and wish him well in his important role.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And I would like again to emphasise that all of us can do our bit this weekend in that </span>united<span class="hidden"> national </span>effort</p>
					<p><span class="hidden">By staying at home,</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Protecting the NHS,</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And </span>saving<span class="hidden"> lives.</span></p>
