					<p><strong>Opening remarks</strong></p>
					<p>Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.</p>
					<p>I’m pleased to be accompanied by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam.</p>
					<p><strong>Latest data</strong></p>
					<p>Let me commence by briefing you on the latest information from the Government’s COBR data file.</p>
					<p>Through our checking and measurement programme, as of today:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>2,219,281 tests for coronavirus have now transpired in the UK, counting a new record of 126,064 tests done yesterday</li>
							<li>233,151 people have certified positive, that’s an increase of 3,446 cases since yesterday</li>
							<li>11,041 people are in hospital with COVID-19, down 14% from a week ago, when 12,802 patients were institutionalised</li>
							<li> and sadly, of those certified positive for coronavirus, 33,614 have now passed away - that’s an increase of 428 fatalities since yesterday.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Today I’m planning to outline how – whilst the country has stood at a virtual standstill – this downtime has been employed to repair and improve the nation’s road and rail infrastructure, along with plans to assist our economy bounce back.</p>
						<p>But before I outline today’s transport announcements, let me briefly reappraise you of the government’s roadmap out of this crisis.</p>
						<p>As you cognise, we have instituted a new COVID Alert System, with five levels - based primarily on the R value and the number of cases.</p>
						<p>Throughout the lockdown, we have stood at Level 4.</p>
						<p>Thanks to the British people, we have induced the R down and we can now commence shifting carefully to Level 3.</p>
						<p>From this week we’re at Step 1, entailing that:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>those who cannot toil from home should now talk to their employer about returning to work</li>
							<li>you can now pass time outdoors and work out as much as you like</li>
							<li>you can greet one person who’s not part of your household outside, provided you remain 2 metres apart</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Step 2 - from June 1, at the earliest, as long as it’s safe, we aspire to permit:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>primary schools to resume for some pupils, in smaller class sizes</li>
							<li>non-essential retail to begin to resume</li>
							<li>cultural and sporting events to occur behind closed doors, without crowds</li>
						</ul>
					<p>And then Step 3 – no earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data indicates it’s safe, we aspire to permit:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>more businesses to convene, incorporating those offering personal care, those in the leisure sector, together with places of worship</li>
						</ul>
					<p>We can command this virus if we remain alert.</p>
					<p>But what does remaining alert actually entail?</p>
					<p>Remaining alert, for the vast majority of people still entails remaining at home as much as possible, and toiling from home if you can.</p>
					<p>But it also means:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>minimising contact with other people</li>
							<li>maintaining your distance if you venture out</li>
							<li>lathering your hands regularly</li>
							<li>sporting a face covering in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to remain socially distant - for example on public transport</li>
							<li>and if you or anyone in your household shows symptoms, you all need to confine yourselves.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>If everyone remains alert and observes the rules, we can command coronavirus by maintaining the R down and lowering the number of infections.</p>
					<p>This is how we can persist to salvage lives, and livelihoods, as we commence as a nation to recoup from coronavirus.</p>
					<p><strong>Transport context</strong></p>
					<p>Today I want to brief you on the measures we’re taking to accelerate our economic recovery while maintaining people's safety.</p>
					<p>For 2 months, we’ve persisted in lockdown, journeying as little as possible, and in behaving so, the whole country has safeguarded the NHS and aided lowering the number of COVID infections.</p>
					<p>But as we commence undertaking tentative steps towards re-establishing our economy and people in some sectors who can’t toil from home commence to repair to their workplaces, it is clear that transport maintains a critical role to perform.</p>
					<p>Last Saturday, I described why it’s our civic duty to bypass public transport, if at all possible.</p>
					<p>Because, even when we have 100% of services functioning, there may only be socially-distanced space available for 1 in 10 passengers.</p>
					<p>Therefore, in order to assist lowering crowding, we outlined  a £2 billion programme to locate cycling and walking at the heart of transport, with £250 million emergency spending already happening.</p>
					<p>Over the past week, we have supplemented this by circulating 3 pieces of detailed guidance.</p>
					<p>First, for local authorities in England, describing how they should brace for significantly-increased numbers of cyclists and pedestrians.</p>
					<p>Next, for the transport sector, to guard they implement safer services for those journeying, and safer workplaces for their staff.</p>
					<p>And third, and most importantly, for passengers.</p>
					<p>We’re appealing to the public to help guard that the transport system does not get significantly overwhelmed by reappearing commuters.</p>
					<p>The guidance clarifies, that if you can’t walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please employ it, rather than journeying by bus, train or tram….</p>
					<p>Especially where that public transport is liable to become overcrowded.</p>
					<p>And, for those people who absolutely need to take public transport…</p>
					<p>It also describes how you can best defend yourself and those around you.</p>
					<p><strong>Transport upgrades during lockdown</strong></p>
					<p>In the coming weeks, as we carefully and cautiously reopen sectors of our economy, and people commence to journey once again…</p>
					<p>They should discern that, whilst the country remained in down-time…</p>
					<p>…with the roads and railways quiet…</p>
					<p>We’ve stayed busy…</p>
					<p>Forging on with essential work….</p>
					<p>Repairing the nation’s infrastructure…</p>
					<p>So we can recoup faster when the time comes.</p>
					<p>This upgrade programme…</p>
					<p>…the kind of work that – at any other time – would generate inevitable disruption and service lags, whilst penalising the taxpayer more…</p>
					<p>…has instead been undertaken in previously unimaginable circumstances of a largely empty transport network.</p>
					<p>For example, we finished 419 separate Network Rail projects over Easter, with a further 1,000 upgrades being done throughout the May bank holidays.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, Highways England has remained busy fast-forwarding maintenance projects on the nation’s roads.</p>
					<p>Last week, for example, we inaugurated the vital A14 upgrade 7 months ahead of schedule.</p>
					<p>This is a route normally taken by 85,000 drivers daily, which will dramatically upgrade access to the UK’s largest container port at Felixstowe and permanently advance the circulation of goods around the UK.</p>
					<p>As Northern Powerhouse minister – I can state that – in the North, we’ve discharged £96 million of rail infrastructure improvements during April.</p>
					<p>And throughout the country, we’ve fast-forwarded maintenance projects on road and rail…</p>
					<p>Whilst always keeping to PHE safety guidelines…..</p>
					<p>So that altogether, Highways England has discharged over £200 million of upgrades, and Network Rail £550 million worth, during April alone.</p>
					<p>I’d like to praise the army of transport and construction workers who have stayed striving very hard throughout the lockdown.</p>
					<p><strong>Building future infrastructure</strong></p>
					<p>But to assure that Britain is ready to rebound from coronavirus…</p>
					<p>Today I can declare nearly £2 billion to upgrade our roads and railways, to establish our transport infrastructure in the best possible shape and to achieve our economy burgeoning once again.</p>
					<p>This package incorporates £1.7 billion for local roads – effecting journeys smoother and safer for drivers, hauliers, cyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians and others…</p>
					<p>By inlaying millions of dangerous potholes, we shall designate our roads safer – and support more people to peddle, or even participate in the upcoming e-scooter trials…</p>
					<p>Supporting more people partaking in allaying pressure on public transport.</p>
					<p>This investment will also assist to repair damage begat by winter flooding, mend roads and bridges, and finance numerous road betterment schemes.</p>
					<p>As more people emerge mobile again, we’ll be constructing a network of rapid energising stations for electric cars…</p>
					<p>Incorporating a big growth of rapid-energising facilities at motorway service stations…</p>
					<p>Assisting the country to sustain the dramatic air-quality improvements we’ve had during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
					<p><strong>A better future</strong></p>
					<p>Amid all the sad news and tragedy of loved ones we’ve forfeited, we’ve somehow fared to accomplish things in weeks that would normally require years…</p>
					<p>Constructing new hospitals…</p>
					<p>Shifting public services online…</p>
					<p>Undertaking instant reforms and speeding-up new laws…</p>
					<p>Extraordinary changes in the way that employers and employees function…</p>
					<p>Effectively transferring large swathes of the economy online almost overnight…</p>
					<p>Now we want to maintain this momentum abounding.</p>
					<p>If constructing a new hospital requires 2 weeks, why should constructing a new road still require as long as 20 years?</p>
					<p>If GP surgeries can quickly shift online, why are most rail passengers still journeying on cardboard tickets?</p>
					<p>We must abuse our newfound capacity to react at pace and turn it to rapidly bettering our infrastructure.</p>
					<p>And we must scrutinise why it is that bureaucratic bindweed occasions British infrastructure as some of the costliest and slowest in Europe to construct.</p>
					<p>Because whilst many will persist to toil from home even after this immediate crisis…</p>
					<p>…both the long-term transport trend and the pressing need to balance communities across the country, stipulate that infrastructure will be even more important in invigorating our recovery and aiding new jobs.</p>
					<p>So by melding fast home-internet access, with vastly improved transport connections, we can help rejuvenate many of our small and medium-sized towns which over decades have remained left behind.</p>
					<p><strong>Closing remarks</strong></p>
					<p>This has transpired as a devastating start to the year, not just for Britain, but for the world.</p>
					<p>And we are only at Phase 1 of the recovery plan.</p>
					<p>But we all understand that it is our reaction to adversity that will ultimately characterise how we recoup.</p>
					<p>We must exploit our approach to dealing with the pandemic….</p>
					<p>And turn it to reconstructing our own infrastructure.</p>
					<p>With the same swift action, innovation, and collective determination that has typified the past few months…..</p>
					<p>And in doing so, we can rise stronger.</p>
