					<p><span class="hidden">Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, our Deputy CMO.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I’ll start with the </span>daily <span class="hidden">update on the latest data on coronavirus:</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="hidden">2,682,716 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK. That includes 100,678 tests carried out yesterday</span></li>
							<li><span class="hidden">246,406 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,684 cases since yesterday</span></li>
							<li><span class="hidden">9,408 people are </span>currently <span class="hidden">in hospital with coronavirus, down 13% from this time last week</span></li>
							<li><span class="hidden">and I’m very sad to report, of those who have tested positive for covid-19, across all settings, 34,796 have now died. That’s an increase of 160 deaths on yesterday</span></li>
						</ul>
					<p><span class="hidden">It goes without saying that we offer our condolences to the friends and family of every individual who has passed away during this coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">It is a challenging time and as we chart the right course over the weeks and months ahead, our overriding priority remains to save lives, whilst also preserving livelihoods and allowing people to return, over time and as and when it’s safe, to something resembling a more normal way of living.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">On 11 May, we set out a road map to provide the information, the advice and the reassurance to businesses, public services, to other organisations, to employees and to citizens up and down the country.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And I want to thank everyone who is making the adjustments and engaging with us in government to forge the path ahead in a sure-footed and sustainable way.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We recognise people will have concerns and questions, and we want to work together with them, and with everyone involved to provide the necessary confidence and reassurance in the next steps that we are poised to make.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">That approach is summarised in the slides which we have up on the screen.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">You’ll see from Slide 1, and as people will be aware, we have established a new COVID Alert System, with 5 levels, each relating to the current level of threat posed by the virus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The alert level is focused on the rate of infection, known as the R value, as well as the total number of coronavirus cases overall.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The alert level helps us determine the social distancing measures that we need to fight the virus. So the lower the level, the fewer or the less restrictive the measures we will need at any given time.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Since the lockdown began, at the end of March, we have been at Level 4 as indicated on the slide.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Thanks to the hard work and the huge sacrifices across the UK, and the progress that we’ve made as a result of that, </span>particularly <span class="hidden">in relation to compliance with the social distancing measures, we are in the process of moving from Level 4 to Level 3 on the slide. We will do that through a number of very careful and deliberate steps.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Last week, the Prime Minister set out the first of 3 steps, designed to </span>carefully <span class="hidden">modify the measures that had been put in place.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">By </span>gradually <span class="hidden">easing certain measures, we can begin to allow people to return to something resembling a more normal way of life.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">The choices we make, what we are asking the British public to do, and what we’re asking them not to do, are designed to avoid the very real risk of a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS and of course risk turning a temporary economic painful moment for the country into permanent damage to the UK economy.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">At every step, we’ll </span>closely <span class="hidden">monitor the impact of easing restrictions, and in particular the impact on the spread of the virus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">It’s </span>only <span class="hidden">by collecting and monitoring the data will we be able to take the next step, which is indicated as Step 2 on the slides, and that will be no earlier than 1 June.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I understand it’s natural for people to question why they can’t do one or other thing right now, or why certain distinctions have been made, but in reality you have to look at the package of measures as a whole, mindful of the risk to the R level and taking into account the various economic and social effects combined.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We’ve adopted a balanced approach, guided at all times by the science, and the overriding need to avoid a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">It’s true to say making any changes </span>inherently <span class="hidden">comes with some risk of spreading the virus compared to </span>simply <span class="hidden">staying at home. But it’s also true that staying in permanent lockdown is itself not sustainable on health grounds or economic grounds.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">That’s why we have </span>only <span class="hidden">eased measures where it can be done with the lowest risk possible. And that’s also why we are watching the impact of every change that we make very closely.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">I know the last couple of months have been </span>really <span class="hidden">tough for families, for businesses, for everyone up and down the UK. But it is </span>only <span class="hidden">by keeping to the plan, sticking to the rules, even including when those rules change, that we will beat coronavirus for good.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">That is why we have asked people to Stay Alert, to Control the Virus to Save Lives as we make changes to the measures in place in England and adjust the government’s advice accordingly.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">For the vast majority of people, that still means staying at home as much as possible. For those that can’t work from home, they should return to work with the arrangements in place to ensure it can be </span>safely <span class="hidden">and </span>responsibly <span class="hidden">done.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">We’ve also adjusted the advice to allow people to exercise more, to visit public outdoor spaces but staying 2 metres apart from those outside their own household.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">As ever, people need to keep washing their hands </span>regularly <span class="hidden">and carrying out the hygiene measures that we’ve advertised before.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Our advice is to wear a face covering when you are outside the home in enclosed spaces and where it’s difficult to </span>socially <span class="hidden">distance, for example if going to the shops or travelling on public transport.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">And if you or anyone in your household develops symptoms, then you still all need to self-isolate.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">Now while we’re asking the public to do these things, we in government will keep ramping up the effort that we need to see to get the UK back to a more normal way of living.</span></p>
					<p><span class="hidden">With that in mind, today, the Health Secretary announced that anyone in the UK with COVID-19 symptoms can now get a test by booking online, and I can also report that we’ve now recruited over 21,000 contact tracers and call handlers in England for the implementation of our test and trace programme. That programme is </span>absolutely <span class="hidden">key in the next steps we need to take as a country to come through this pandemic </span>safely <span class="hidden">and <p><span class="hidden">responsibly.</span></p>
