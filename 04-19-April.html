					<p><span class="redacted">I’d like</span> to welcome <span class="redacted">you</span> to today’s <span class="redacted">briefing from Downing Street.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I am joined by Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, who will be sharing with you the latest detailed data on coronavirus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">On any normal Sunday afternoon, many of you would have been out with your family and friends enjoying the sunshine. And tomorrow, many children would be </span>going to school <span class="redacted">for the first time after a two-week break.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">But these are not normal times and we are asking you</span> to stay at home,<span class="redacted"> so can I start by thanking you for all the sacrifices that you’ve already</span> had to make and <span class="redacted">that you</span> continue to make.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I know this has not been easy. But it’s the surest way that we have</span> to protect <span class="redacted">the NHS and</span> to save <span class="redacted">lives.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I can report, through the Government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today 482,063 tests for coronavirus have been carried out in Great Britain, including 21,626 test carried out yesterday.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">120,067 people have tested positive - that’s an increase of 5,850 cases since yesterday. 18,118 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, compared</span> to 18,006 <span class="redacted">on 17 April.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 16,060 have now died. That’s an increase of 596 fatalities since yesterday.
					<p><span class="redacted">We mustn’t forget that behind every single statistic there is a heart-breaking story and my sincere</span> condolences go out to everyone <span class="redacted">has lost someone that they love.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">These are challenging times for all of us and</span> each of us has a role to play <span class="redacted">in fighting this virus. Those who are working in the NHS, those doctors, nurses, porters, cleaners and ambulance crews. They’re all doing an amazing job and are truly heroic in the part they are playing in supporting every one of us in this nation.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">But today I would also like</span> to say <span class="redacted">how enormously grateful we are</span> to those who are working <span class="redacted">in our nurseries, schools colleges, universities and children’s services.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I am profoundly grateful for the vital role they are providing in our communities.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">They have been keeping schools and nurseries open – including over the Easter holidays - so that our most vulnerable children and children of critical workers can continue to be supported and they can be cared for.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">People are anxious</span> to know <span class="redacted">when we are going</span> to relax <span class="redacted">restrictions and when schools are likely to be fully back and open again. Of course, I want nothing more than to get schools back to normal, make sure that children are sat around learning and experiencing the joy of being at school.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">But I can’t give you a date, because before we do, we need</span> to meet five tests.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">First, we must protect the NHS’s ability</span> to cope and be sure <span class="redacted">that it can continue</span> to provide <span class="redacted">critical care and specialist treatment right across the whole of the UK.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Second,</span> we need to <span class="redacted">the daily death rates from coronavirus coming down.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Third, we</span> need to have reliable data <span class="redacted">that shows the rate of infection is</span> decreasing to manageable levels.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Fourth, we need<span> to be confident <span class="redacted">that testing capacity and PPE are being managed, with supply able</span> to meet <span class="redacted">not just today’s demand, but future demand.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And, fifth, and perhaps most crucially,</span> we need to be confident <span class="redacted">any changes we do make will not risk a second peak of infections.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">When we can be sure we have met these five essential points, we can think about getting children into schools again - learning, mastering new ideas and being with their friends once more.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We will work with the sector</span> to consider <span class="redacted">how best</span> to reopen <span class="redacted">schools, nurseries and colleges when the time is right.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Our first priority has always been protecting the wellbeing of children and young people, but particularly those vulnerable young people with special educational needs or a social worker.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Schools are open for them and we’re working</span> to make sure <span class="redacted">those who should attend do so.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Places are available for children of critical workers too.</span> With up to 130,000 <span class="redacted">children in school every single day, schools are helping keep the country moving.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And we are asking our local authorities and</span> schools to ensure <span class="redacted">every vulnerable child knows that their school is there</span> to support <span class="redacted">them, that systems are in place</span> to keep <span class="redacted">in touch with those children who are unable</span> to attend because <span class="redacted">of health reasons.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I know that families of seriously ill and disabled children are particularly worried at this time and</span> I’m grateful to all <span class="redacted">staff who are</span> working so hard to support<span class="redacted"> their education, health and care – particularly those in special schools and residential care homes.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Young people who have left care or are just</span> about to, <span class="redacted">whether that’s from a foster family or residential care, are really vulnerable right now. So I am asking local authorities</span> to ensure <span class="redacted">that</span> no one has to leave <span class="redacted">care during this difficult time.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">The £1.6 billion of additional funding announced yesterday will help local authorities give care leavers, and other vulnerable groups, the support that they need at this difficult time.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">To further protect children from harm, we are continuing</span> to support <span class="redacted">Childline and working with NSPCC</span> to expand <span class="redacted">and promote the adult helpline by providing them with an extra £1.6 million.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">This means children have someone</span> to call <span class="redacted">and more adults will be able</span> to raise <span class="redacted">concerns and seek advice about the safety and wellbeing of any child that they’re worried about.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Like the rest of the population, all our teachers have had</span> to adapt <span class="redacted">very quickly</span> to new ways of working. <span class="redacted">They have had</span> to move resources <span class="redacted">online, work remotely, change the way they support their students as well as one another.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I am immensely grateful</span> to them <span class="redacted">and</span> to everyone <span class="redacted">who has offered their support, including those who have made resources freely available for schools, parents and pupils</span> to use.</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We have already published an initial list of high quality online educational resources including how</span> to support <span class="redacted">physical and mental wellbeing and materials for teaching children with special educational needs and disabilities.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">In yet another example of how we are at our best when we work together, some of our leading state schools have collaborated</span> to open <span class="redacted">The Oak National Academy, which will be launched online tomorrow (20 April).</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">This is a totally new initiative, led by 40 brilliant teachers who have assembled video lessons and resources for any teacher in the country</span> to make use <span class="redacted">of if they wish</span> to do so.<span class="redacted"> 180 video lessons will be provided each week, across a broad range of subjects, for every year group from Reception through to Year 10.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I recognise all the challenges that families will be facing at the moment and we are determined</span> to support <span class="redacted">parents who are helping their children learn from home. I think we all know how difficult that can be.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">The BBC has developed resources for families as part of the most comprehensive education package in their history, available on TV and online from tomorrow morning.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And</span> to make sure <span class="redacted">as many children as possible can access online learning, we are ordering laptops</span> to help <span class="redacted">disadvantaged young people who sit key exams next year.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We will also provide laptops and tablets for those children with social workers and care leavers</span> to help them <span class="redacted">stay in touch with the services they need, keeping them safe and supporting home learning.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And if disadvantaged secondary school pupils and care leavers who are preparing for exams do not already have internet connections, we’ll provide free 4G routers</span> to get <span class="redacted">them connected while schools are closed.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We are also working with major telecommunications providers</span> to exempt <span class="redacted">certain educational resources from data charges, so that this does</span> not add to <span class="redacted">household expenses that may already be very stretched at this moment.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Before I finish, I would like</span> to applaud <span class="redacted">the remarkable way our education community has responded</span> to this outbreak.<span class="redacted"> I am enormously proud and inspired by the incredible spirit they are showing.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Schools are supporting their communities in every way, from preparing food parcels</span> to sharing <span class="redacted">their facilities with local hospitals. Colleges are manufacturing and donating equipment and universities are working flat out</span> to develop <span class="redacted">diagnostic tests and, of course, a vaccine which will help us beat this invisible enemy.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And</span> to any young people <span class="redacted">watching,I wanted</span> to say to you <span class="redacted">how sorry I am that you have had your education disrupted in this way.
					<p><span class="redacted">I know how hard it must be and I would like to thank you for making the adjustments you have had</span> to make</p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I know you will be missing your friends, your teachers and your lessons. I want</span> you to know <span class="redacted">that you are an important part of this fight too and I cannot thank you enough for all that you are doing.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">This global pandemic is the biggest threat that this country has faced in modern times. If we all continue</span> to work <span class="redacted">together, as we have been, and if we continue</span> to stick to <span class="redacted">the advice of our experts, we will come out the other side</span> and be able to <span class="redacted">begin the task of rebuilding our communities.</span></p>
