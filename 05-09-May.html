					<p><span class="redacted"><b>Opening remarks</b>
					<p><span class="redacted">Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I’m pleased to be joined today by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted"><b>Latest data</b></span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Let me start by updating you on the latest information from the COBR data file.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">I can report that through the government’s monitoring and testing programme, as of today…..</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="redacted">1, 728,443 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 96, 878 tests yesterday</span></li>
							<li><span class="redacted">215,260 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,896 cases since yesterday</span></li>
							<li><span class="redacted">11,809 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down from 12,284 yesterday</span></li>
						</ul>
					<p><span class="redacted">And tragically, of those hospitalised with the virus, 31,587 have now died. That’s an increase of 346 fatalities since yesterday.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">These deaths are devastating for the families and friends of victims, who are in our thoughts and prayers are with all of them every day.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">But they also strengthen our resolve to fight this pandemic with all the resources we can muster in the weeks ahead….</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted"><b>Planning for restart/opportunity for lasting change</b></span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Tomorrow, the Prime Minister will set out a roadmap for the next phase in our strategy to tackle coronavirus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">In support of this, I am setting out today an ambitious programme to help prepare our transport network for the critical role it will play as we emerge from this crisis.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Importantly, it is true to say that moving beyond COVID will be a gradual process… not a single-leap to freedom.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">When we do emerge, the world will seem quite different, at least for a while.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">The need to maintain social distancing means that our public transport system cannot go back to where it left off.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Here is a very stark fact…</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Even with public transport reverting to full service - once you take into account the 2 metre social distancing rule – there would only be effective capacity for one in ten passengers on many parts of the network.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Just a tenth of the old capacity.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">So, getting Britain moving again, while not overcrowding our transport network, is going to require many of us to think carefully about how and when we travel.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted"><b>Everyone involved</b></span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We have accomplished so much over the past 7 weeks of lockdown.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">The whole country has been responsible for reducing the COVID reproduction or ‘R’ rate…</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Millions of households across the UK have changed their behaviour for the greater good.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Getting Britain moving again, whilst not overcrowding our transport network, represents another enormous logistical challenge.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Yet this is a problem which presents a health opportunity too…. an opportunity to make lasting changes that could not only make us fitter, but also better-off – both mentally and physically – in the long run.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted"><b>Active travel</b></span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">During the crisis, millions of people have discovered the benefits of active travel.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">By cycling or walking, we’ve been able to enjoy this remarkably warm spring whilst sticking to the guidelines.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">In some places, there’s been a 70% rise in the number of people on bikes whether it’s for exercise, or necessary journeys, such as stocking up on food.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">So, while it’s still crucial that we stay at home, when the country does get back to work, we need those people to carry on cycling and walking, and to be joined by many more.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Otherwise, with public transport capacity severely restricted, more cars could be drawn to the road and our towns and cities could become gridlocked.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We also know that in this new world, pedestrians will need more space.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">So today (9 May 2020) I am announcing a £2 billion package to put cycling and walking at the heart of our transport policy.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">To set out how we will deliver this, I will bring forward a national cycling plan for publication in early June, in line with the statutory Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy to help double cycling and increase walking by 2025.
					<p><span class="redacted">The first stage, worth £250 million, is a series of swift, emergency interventions to make cycling and walking safer.
					<p><span class="redacted">Pop-up bike lanes. Wider pavements. Cycle and bus-only streets. All examples of what people will start to see more of.
					<p><span class="redacted">Accompanying the new money, we are today publishing fast-tracked statutory guidance, effective immediately, requiring councils in England to cater for significantly-increased numbers of cyclists and pedestrians, and making it easier for them to create safer streets.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">For employees who want to start cycling to their place of work, but who don’t have a bike right now, the popular Cycle to Work Scheme already allows employees to save between 25% and 39% on the cost of a new bike or an electric bike.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">There has been a huge increase in people using the scheme, and we will work with employers to increase uptake further.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And for those who may have an old bike in the shed, and want to get it back into a roadworthy condition, there will be a voucher scheme for bike repairs and maintenance.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Plans are also being developed to boost bike fixing facilities.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">What’s more, over the next few months, we will set out further measures to make a ‘once in a generation’ change to the way people travel in Britain.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">These will include tough new standards for cycling infrastructure;</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="redacted">a new national cycling champion to inspire us</span></li>
							<li><span class="redacted">much closer links with the NHS, with GPs prescribing cycling to help us get fitter</span></li>
							<li><span class="redacted">legal changes to protect vulnerable road users</span></li>
							<li><span class="redacted">at least one “zero-emission city,” with its centre restricted to bikes and electric vehicles</span></li>
							<li><span class="redacted">and the creation of a long-term cycling programme and budget, just like we have for our roads</span></li>
						</ul>
					<p><span class="redacted">There’s clear evidence, including from the Prime Minister’s time as mayor of London, that making streets safe for walking and cycling is good for retailers, business and the economy.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted"><b>Green travel / E-scooters / E-vehicles</b></span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And in making these changes, our national recovery can also become a green recovery.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">One of the few positive benefits about the crisis is drastically better air quality and the health benefits that that brings.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">More than 20,000 extra deaths a year in the UK are attributed to nitrogen dioxide emissions, which are highest in areas with most road traffic.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">We want to try to preserve this as much as possible.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">So today I’m also fast-tracking trials of e-scooters, bringing this programme, already underway, forward from next year, to next month….</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And extending those trials from four local authorities to every region in the country that wants them….</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">… in a bid to get e-scooter rental schemes up-and-running in our cities as fast as possible….</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Helping reduce car use on shorter journeys, and taking some pressure off buses, at this vital time.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">These trials will help us assess their safety and benefits, together with their impact on public spaces.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">The car industry has of course been very badly hit during this crisis, but April’s new sales figures showed – for the first time – that the two biggest selling models were both electric vehicles.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">So, to help keep this quiet, clean car revolution going, I can also announce today, £10 million of additional support for car-charging points on our streets.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">The car will remain the mainstay for many families and, as well as backing electric infrastructure, we’re going to accelerate the filling of pot-holes that plague so many road users.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted"><b>Data</b></span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And just as new technology is changing the vehicles we use, so new digital technologies will help us make more informed transport choices in our battle against Covid.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">At a time when transport demand could quickly overwhelm capacity if users have no access to real-time travel information…</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">… It is crucial that we take advantage of the UK’s digital tech expertise.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">With the right mobile apps, people can find out which parts of the transport network are overcrowded. And avoid them!
					<p><span class="redacted">They can choose alternative travel options, to help maintain safe social distancing…</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">… or they can get information to help stagger their journeys - and lift the burden on public transport at peak times.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">This week I chaired a roundtable with key players like Google, Microsoft, and British firm, Citymapper, to develop both data and apps to help the public view crowding across the transport network, in real-time.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted"><b>Overall package</b></span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">This £2 billion announcement represents the most significant package of cycling, walking and green travel by any British government.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Clearly, it will never be possible to cycle, walk or e-scooter everywhere. Cars will remain an absolutely vital form of transport for many….</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And so in the coming days…</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">as we look to the future…</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">… there will be further announcements about the huge investment we’re making in road and rail networks – taking advantage of their low usership during this COVID crisis.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted"><b>Closing remarks</b></span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Finally, as we begin the process of preparing public transport to get Britain moving again, no-one should underestimate the sheer scale of the challenge ahead.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Even with every train, bus and tram fully restored to service – this will not be enough.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Social distancing measures mean that everyone who travels will need to contribute to meeting this capacity challenge.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Changing our behaviour is the single biggest thing that’s beaten back this virus.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">The welcome fall we’ve seen in deaths is not only the achievement of our doctors and nurses and careworkers - but of everyone in the country for following the stay at home guidance.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">To re-iterate, nothing I have said today changes these basic rules.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">But as we contemplate the future, we will have to carry on making changes, particularly after we leave our homes.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Preventing overcrowding – which could lead to a second spike and more deaths – will be the responsibility of each and every one of us.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">So please, only travel when you need to.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">Be considerate to others, and help us prioritise essential workers.</span></p>
					<p><span class="redacted">And let’s all play our part in Britain moving safely again when that time comes.</span></p>
