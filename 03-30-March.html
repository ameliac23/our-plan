				<p><span class="hidden"> Good afternoon, welcome to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press briefing. I’m joined by our Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance and Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England. </p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Before Sir Patrick provides an update on the latest data from our COBR coronavirus dashboard, </span>I<span class="hidden"> just want to give you an update on the steps that we as </span>a<span class="hidden"> government are taking to defeat coronavirus. </p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, thereby protecting the NHS’ capacity. At each point we have been following the scientific and medical advice and we’ve been very deliberate in our actions - taking the right steps at the right moment. </p>
				<p><span class="hidden">We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the numbers of beds, key staff, life-saving equipment on the frontline so that we give people the care they need when they need it most. </p>
				<p><span class="hidden">That’s why we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.</span></p>
				<p></span>I<span class="hidden"> can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:</span></p>
					<ul class="hidden">
						<li>134,946 people have now been tested for the virus</li>
						<li>112,805 have tested negative</li>
						<li>22,141 have tested positive</li>
					</ul>
				<p><span class="hidden">Of those who have contracted the virus, 1,408 have, very sadly, died. We express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who have passed away and </span>I<span class="hidden"> think those figures are </span>a<span class="hidden"> powerful reminder to us all of the importance of following the government’s guidelines.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">We must stay at home to protect our NHS and save lives.</span></p>
				<p></span>I<span class="hidden"> would like to thank all those involved on the frontline and in particular all of those in the NHS for their battle against the virus, the amazing doctors, the amazing nurses and all the support staff working day and night.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">The thousands of other key workers – from our teachers to supermarket workers to our fantastic diplomatic network – who are all as </span>a<span class="hidden"> team working around the clock to get us through this unprecedented coronavirus challenge.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">This is </span>a<span class="hidden"> united national effort and the spirit of selflessness shown by so many is an inspiration.</span></p>
				<p></span>I<span class="hidden"> now want to turn to what we’ve been doing to support British people travelling around the world.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Coronavirus hasn’t just challenged us at home, it is the greatest global challenge in </span>a<span class="hidden"> generation. And as countries work to secure their borders and stop the further spread of this deadly virus, we appreciate that an unprecedented number of UK travellers are trying to get home, and we’re not talking </span>a<span class="hidden"> few hundred or even </span>a<span class="hidden"> few thousand. We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of people travelling around the world.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">So with that in mind, on 17 March, we advised people against all non-essential travel around the world.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">And since 23 March, we have advised all UK residents who were currently travelling abroad should return home. Hundreds of thousands have already done so.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">But many travellers haven’t yet managed to get home. From young back-packers to retired couples on cruises. We appreciate the difficult predicament that they find themselves in.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">We also recognise the anxiety of families here in the UK, who are concerned to get their loved ones home. It is </span>a<span class="hidden"> worrying time for all those who have been affected.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">And </span>I<span class="hidden"> want to reassure them that this government, their government is working around the clock to support, advise and help British travellers get home.</span></p>
				<p></span>I<span class="hidden"> have spoken to more than 20 foreign ministers around the world in the last week or so to support this effort, to keep airports and ports open, and to facilitate access to them by British travellers.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Over the weekend, </span>I<span class="hidden"> spoke to foreign ministers from Australia, New Zealand, India and Brazil and Pakistan, and </span>I<span class="hidden"> also spoke to the Ethiopian Prime Minister, and in all of those cases urged them to work with us and keep commercial routes flying.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Given the scale and the complexity of this challenge, it inevitably requires </span>a<span class="hidden"> team effort. So the Foreign Office is working with other governments, and there is </span>a<span class="hidden"> particular focus on transit hubs, and we’re also working with the airlines to keep as many flights running as possible.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">We have </span>a<span class="hidden"> lot more to do, but we have already helped hundreds of thousands of Britons get home.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">The first priority has been to keep as many commercial flights running as we can, and that’s based on just purely the scale and the number of people who want to come home.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">As </span>a<span class="hidden"> result of those efforts, and the cooperation we received from the Spanish government, we’ve enabled an estimated 150,000 UK nationals to get back from Spain. On other commercial routes that have come under pressure, we’ve worked with partner governments and airlines to get back 8,500 UK travellers back from Morocco and around 5,000 UK nationals from Cyprus.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">That gives you </span>a<span class="hidden"> sense of the scale of the challenge and the numbers of British travellers abroad.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Now in circumstances where commercial flights can’t operate, we have already chartered flights, which proved necessary to return 1,400 UK nationals on flights, for example, from China at the outset of this crisis and and more recently from Peru.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">We’ve not faced challenges in getting people home from abroad, on this scale, in recent memory. Airports are closing down or preventing airlines from operating on </span>a<span class="hidden"> commercial basis. Local authorities have placed restrictions on movement that prevent people from getting to the airport. And the critical transit hubs that we rely on for long-haul flights are also shutting down, or in some cases, limiting their flights.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Some of these restrictions have been done with very little notice, some with no notice at all which makes it very difficult to respond. So, international collaboration is absolutely vital.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">As </span>I<span class="hidden"> said, it is </span>a<span class="hidden"> team effort, in it involves government working with other governments and also with the airlines.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">So with that in mind, </span>I<span class="hidden"> can today announce </span>a<span class="hidden"> new arrangement between the government and airlines to fly home tens of thousands of stranded British travellers, where commercial flights are no longer possible. Partner airlines include British Airways, Virgin, Easyjet, Jet2 and Titan, and this list can be expanded.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Under the arrangements that we are putting in place, we will target flights from </span>a<span class="hidden"> range of priority countries, starting this week.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Let me explain </span>a<span class="hidden"> little bit about how this will work in practise.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Where commercial routes remain an option, airlines will be responsible for getting passengers home. That means offering alternative flights at little to no cost where routes have been cancelled. And it means allowing passengers to change tickets, including between carriers.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">So for those still in those in countries where commercial options are still available, don’t wait. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. The airlines are standing by to help you. Please book your tickets as soon as possible.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Where commercial flights are no longer running, the government will provide the necessary financial support for special charter flights to bring UK nationals back home. Once special charter flights have been arranged, we will promote flights them through the government’s travel advice and by the British Embassy or High Commission in the relevant country.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">British travellers who want </span>a<span class="hidden"> seat on those flight will book and pay directly through </span>a<span class="hidden"> dedicated travel management company.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">We designated £75 million to support those flights and airlines to keep costs down and affordable for those seeking to return to the UK.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">In arranging these flights, our priority will be the most vulnerable, including the elderly or those with particularly pressing medical needs, and also looking in particular at countries where large numbers of UK tourists struggling to get home.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">UK travellers, if they haven’t already done so, should check Foreign Office Travel Advice and that advice is under constant review, and it can help travellers to find out more details of how to access the flights under this arrangement.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">They should also follow the social media of the UK embassy or high commission in the country where they find themselves, so that they can be directed to accurate real time information, including from the local authorities.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">For any questions that can’t be answered in that travel advice, or by the UK Embassies or High Commission, we also have our call centre working 24 hours </span>a<span class="hidden"> day, 7 days </span>a<span class="hidden"> week.</span></p>
				<p></span>I<span class="hidden"> know that it has been difficult for some travellers to get through. Just to give you </span>a<span class="hidden"> sense of volume: on average, we normally receive 1,000 calls </span>a<span class="hidden"> day to that call centre. Last Tuesday, we had nearly 15,000 – the highest on record.</p>
				<p><span class="hidden">So we’ve boosted our resources, we’ve redeployed people to assist in the call centre and we’ve tripled our capacity.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">Yesterday, the call centre answered 99% of calls, and helped thousands of British travellers to get the answers they need.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">So, for those stranded, or for families nervously waiting news and wanting to see their loved ones return home, we are doing everything we can. We have improved our advice and boosted the call centre, so travellers get better and swifter information.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">We have put in place this arrangement with the airlines so that we can reach British citizens in vulnerable circumstances abroad where commercial flights aren’t running. And we’re working intensively round the clock with all of our partner countries and governments around the world to keep open the airports, the ports and the flights to bring people home.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">We’ve not faced an international challenge quite like this before, but together we are going to rise to it.</span></p>
				<p><span class="hidden">And, of course here at home, we can all support our NHS by continuing to follow the guidance to:</span></p>
