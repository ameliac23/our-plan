					<p>Those deaths are not just a list of statistics but a reminder</p>
					<p>a devastating reminder</p>
					<p>of the cruelty of coronavirus</p>
					<br>
					<p>Our thoughts are with the friends</p>
					<p>and our thoughts are with the families</p>
					<p>of the victims of coronavirus</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Transport context</strong></p>
					<p>As we start to relax</p>
					<p>As we start to relax the restrictions</p>
					<p>we must plan</p>
					<p>plan our route to recovery</p>
					<p>Allowing people to resume their lives</p>
					<p>to resume their lives where possible</p>
					<p>Getting businesses running</p>
					<p>Getting businesses up and running</p>

					<br>
					<p>We will bring back</p>
					<p>We will need to bring back</p>
					<p>We will need to bring back more public transport</p>
					<p>In the short term, we will need to bring back</p>
					<p>more public transport</p>
					<p>to keep families safe</p>
					<br>
					<p>That process has already begun
					<br>
					<p>Rail and tube services increased this week</p>
					<p>increased, at the beginning of this week</p>
					<p>And they'll ramp up more next month</p>
					<br>
					<p>And to ensure that buses return</p>
					<p>that more buses, trams and light-rail networks return</p>
					<p>more buses, trams and light-rail networks return to service</p>
					<p>today I can announce investment</p>
					<p>new investment of £283 million</p>
					<p>to start moving back</p>
					<p>to a full timetable</p>
					<br>
					<p>I want to stress</p>
					<p>However I do want to stress</p>
					<p>this funding does not mean we can use public transport</p>
					<p>it does not mean we can go back to using public transport</p>
					<p>whenever we like</p>
					<p>Remember</p>
					<p>Those who can should work from home</p>
					<p>Those who can should still work from home</p>
					<p>Those who can should still avoid public transport</p>
					<p>- all public transport</p>
					<br>
					<p>A fully restored service will carry one fifth of capacity</p>
					<p>A fully restored service will carry – at best – one fifth of capacity</p>
					<p>A fully restored service will be capable of carrying – at best</p>
					<p>one fifth of normal capacity</p>
					<p>once social distancing is taken into account</p>
					<br>
					<p>So if you need to travel</p>
					<p>So only if you need to travel</p>
					<p>and you can't cycle, or walk or drive</p>
					<p>only if you can't cycle, or walk or drive</p>
					<p>should you take a bus, tram or train</p>
					<br>
					<p>But please avoid the rush hour</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Marshals</strong></p>
					<p>We're managing the transport network</p>
					<p>to make it safe</p>
					<p>to make it as safe as possible</p>
					<br>
					<p>This week saw the deployment of nearly 3,500 employees</p>
					<p>3,500 British Transport Police, Network Rail and Transport for London employees</p>
					<p>These marshals worked with the public</p>
					<p>worked with the public to prevent services from becoming overcrowded</p>
					<br>
					<p>From 1 June we will deploy twice as many marshals</p>
					<p>From 1 June at the earliest we deploy twice as many marshals</p>
					<p>From the 1 June at the earliest – as we move to phase 2 of the unlock</p>
					<p>we will start to deploy twice as many marshals</p>
					<p>with the assistance of groups like the charity – Volunteering Matters</p>
					<br>
					<p>These Journey Makers will provide reassurance</p>
					<p>These Journey Makers will help provide reassurance</p>
					<p>These Journey Makers will help provide reassurance</p>
					<p>advice and assistance</p>
					<p>friendly assistance</p>
					<p>to commuters</p>
					<br>
					<p>The last time we did this it was a success</p>
					<p>The last time we did this it was a great success</p>
					<p>The last time we did this, at the 2012 Olympics</p>
					<p>it was a great success</p>
					<br>
					<p>While these are more serious times</p>
					<p>While these are altogether more serious times</p>
					<p>if we show the concern for one another</p>
					<p>if we show the same public-spirited concern for one another</p>
					<p>it will go a way towards helping</p>
					<p>it will go a long way toward helping</p>
					<p>transport and passengers cope</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>ZipAbout</strong></p>
					<p>As I have said</p>
					<p>it's essential we stagger journeys</p>
					<p>stagger journeys and avoid the rush hour</p>
					<p>That's why we asked the tech sector</p>
					<p>why, at a recent roundtable, we asked the tech sector</p>
					<p>to come up with proposals</p>
					<p>innovative proposals to help passengers avoid congestion</p>
					<br>
					<p>One example is 'Passenger Connect'</p>
					<p>One good example is 'Passenger Connect'</p>
					<p>One good example is 'Passenger Connect' from Birmingham start-up ZipAbout</p>
					<p>A personalised information service</p>
					<p>which tells rail users how disruption may affect their journey</p>
					<p>how disruption and crowding may affect their journey</p>
					<p>while providing alternatives and helping people</p>
					<p>to maintain social distancing</p>
					<br>
					<p>This service has been piloted</p>
					<p>successfully piloted</p>
					<p>over the past 12 months</p>
					<p>and it will be rolled out soon</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Building for the future</strong></p>
					<p>We're not just dealing with the challenges of the present</p>
					<p>the immense challenges of the present</p>
					<p>we're building  for the future too</p>
					<br>
					<p>Transport is how we get from place to place</p>
					<p>is not just about how we get from place to place</p>
					<p>it also shapes the places</p>
					<p>for good or bad</p>
					<p>Towns. Cities. Whole nations</p>
					<br>
					<p>We have an opportunity</p>
					<p>We now have an opportunity</p>
					<p>to use transport</p>
					<p>to use the power of transport</p>
					<p>to improve national weaknesses</p>
					<p>long-standing national weaknesses</p>
					<p>and create something better</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Rebalancing the economy</strong></p>
					<p>The UKs economy is one weakness</p>
					<p>The UKs economy is one such weakness</p>
					<p>The UKs unbalanced economy is one such weakness</p>
					<p>our mission is to level-up Britain</p>
					<br>
					<p>The COVID-19 outbreak must be the catalyst</p>
					<p>the catalyst to get it done</p>
					<p>levelling up. And speeding up</p>
					<br>
					<p>So while roads and railways are less busy</p>
					<p>we're accelerating projects</p>
					<p>we're accelerating vital projects</p>
					<br>
					<p>Take the North, for example</p>
					<br>
					<p>This weekend</p>
					<p>This bank holiday weekend</p>
					<p>we're carrying out work to fix Leeds station</p>
					<p>vital work to fix Leeds station</p>
					<p>continuing to build a platform</p>
					<p>a new platform</p>
					<p>installing new points and switches</p>
					<p>and improving the track to Wakefield</p>
					<br>
					<p>Just part of 490 engineering projects</p>
					<p>490 separate engineering  projects</p>
					<p> happening around the country</p>
					<p>around the country this weekend</p>
					<p>this bank holiday weekend</p>
					<br>
					<p>Works that would normally take months of closures</p>
					<p>months of weekend closures</p>
					<p>are quicker</p>
					<p>much quicker</p>
					<p>on these quieter railways</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Beeching cuts</strong></p>
					<p>And we're reversing some of the Beeching cuts</p>
					<p>We're reversing some of the so-called Beeching rail cuts</p>
					<p>We're getting on with plans to reverse some of the so-called Beeching rail cuts too</p>
					<br>
					<p>Dr Beeching wrote a report</p>
					<p>which led to the closure of one-third of our railway network</p>
					<p>Dr Beeching wrote a report back in the 1960s</p>
					<p>which led to the closure of one-third of our railway network</p>
					<p>2,363 stations, 5,000 miles of track identified for closure</p>
					<br>
					<p>Many of the places removed never recovered</p>
					<p>The places removed from the map never recovered</p>
					<p>That report was the origin</p>
					<p>That report was perhaps the origin of the 'left-behind town'</p>
					<br>
					<p>But we're reversing Beeching</p>
					<p>we're working to reverse Beeching</p>
					<p>The process has started</p>
					<p>The process has already started</p>
					<p>in Blyth in the North East and Fleetwood in the North West</p>
					<br>
					<p>I visited in January and took the opportunity to visit Horden Peter Lee</p>
					<p>I visited and also took the opportunity to visit Horden Peter Lee</p>
					<p>to see the work</p>
					<p>the building work</p>
					<br>
					<p>There used to be a station</p>
					<p>a train station</p>
					<p>200 yards away</p>
					<p>but it was closed</p>
					<p>and the town cut off</p>
					<p>cut off by the Beeching axe</p>
					<br>
					<p>This station</p>
					<p>this new station</p>
					<p>will connect a community</p>
					<p>improving their life</p>
					<p>will connect a community of people</p>
					<p>improving their quality of life</p>
					<br>
					<p>This new station will connect a community of over 50,00 people</p>
					<p>improving their quality of life</p>
					<br>
					<p>And today the next schemes are announced</p>
					<p>the next 10 schemes are announced</p>
					<p>the next 10 schemes to benefit are announced</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's funding</p>
					<p>it's development funding...</p>
					<p>but if they stack up then we're going to build them</p>
					<p>if they stack up then we're going to build them fast</p>
					<br>
					<p>Amongst the schemes is the reinstatement</p>
					<p>Amongst the many schemes is the reinstatement</p>
					<p>of the Ivanhoe line</p>
					<p>the Ivanhoe line in the East Midlands</p>
					<p>From Leicester to Burton</p>
					<p>via Coalville and Ashby</p>
					<p>And lines on the Isle of Wight</p>
					<p>branch lines on the Isle of Wight</p>
					<p>and a station at Wellington</p>
					<p>a new station at Wellington</p>
					<p>in Somerset</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Roads</strong></p>
					<p>But no matter how great we make the railway</p>
					<p>the railway of the future</p>
					<p>millions will rely on the car</p>
					<p>millions will still rely on the car</p>
					<p>That's why I'm publishing the route</p>
					<p>the route to complete the dual carriageway on the A66</p>
					<p>today I'm publishing the route</p>
					<p>the preferred route</p>
					<p> to complete the dual carriageway on the A66</p>

					<p>This is a programme</p>
					<p>a £1 billion programme that will transform capacity</p>
					<p>by upgrading junctions and widening the road</p>
					<p>These road and rail schemes will be the first</p>
					<p>will be the first of many</p>
					<p>binding our country together</p>
					<p>and connecting people</p>
					<p>connecting people with jobs</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Towns and cities</strong></p>
					<p>But it isn't the balance between regions</p>
					<p>that we need to reshape</p>
					<p>It isn't just the balance between regions</p>
					<p>that we need to reshape</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's hard to see millions going back</p>
					<p>back to the same old ways</p>
					<p>hard to see millions</p>
					<p>who commuted by train into Manchester, London, Birmingham</p>
					<p>going back to the same old ways</p>
					<p>hard to see millions who</p>
					<p>– until a few weeks ago</p>
					<p>commuted by train into Manchester, London, Birmingham every day</p>
					<p>immediately going back to the same old ways</p>
					<p>So we have to reshape our towns</p>
					<p> and cities</p>
					<p>we have to reshape our towns and cities too</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Prime Minister once said:</p>
					<p>"Cities are where inspiration and innovation happens...because people can bump into each other, spark off one another, compete, collaborate, invent and innovate. That's when we get the explosion, or flash of creativity and innovation."</p>
					<br>
					<p>And yet it makes that difficult</p>
					<p>with social distancing</p>
					<p>it makes all that  more difficult</p>
					<p>rather more difficult</p>
					<p>so we have to find ways</p>
					<p>new ways of making it happen</p>
					<p>Therefore we will be looking to support ways</p>
					<p>to support creative ways  for businesses to reopen</p>
					<p>As conditions allow</p>
					<p>– and not until July –</p>
					<p>we will be looking to support creative ways for businesses to reopen</p>
					<p>whilst maintaining social distancing</p>
					<br>
					<p>We know restaurants and bars will start trading again</p>
					<p>We know restaurants and bars will want to start trading again</p>
					<p>and we will work with them so we can enjoy a summer</p>
					<p>an outdoor summer in a safe environment</p>
					<p>a safe and responsible environment</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Car parking</strong></p>
					<p>For those who live too far to cycle and walk</p>
					<p>and must drive to major conurbations</p>
					<p>we will repurpose parking outside town centres</p>
					<p>in places just outside town centres</p>
					<p>so people can park and finish their journeys on foot or bike or even e-scooter</p>
					<p>park on the outskirts and finish their journeys on foot or bike or even e-scooter</p>
					<br>
					<p>Our aim with these measures</p>
					<p>with many of these measures</p>
					<p>is not to get through restrictions</p>
					<p>merely to get through the lifting of restrictions</p>
					<p>and then return to how things were</p>
					<p>but to come out stronger</p>
					<p>by changing</p>
					<p>by permanently changing</p>
					<br>
					<p>To come out of this recovery stronger by permanently changing the way we use transport</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Cycling</strong></p>
					<p>Take the bike</p>
					<p>take the bike</p>
					<p>for example</p>
					<br>
					<p>We announced a scheme to bring bicycles back</p>
					<p>The introduction of a scheme to help bring bicycles back</p>
					<p>Previously we announced the introduction of a scheme to help bring bicycles back</p>
					<p>to a roadworthy condition</p>
					<p>relieving the pressure on public transport</p>
					<p>and improving the nation's health</p>
					<br>
					<p>Today I provide the detail of the voucher</p>
					<p>Today I can provide the detail of the new £50 bicycle maintenance voucher</p>
					<p>available next month</p>
					<p>available from next month</p>
					<br>
					<p>The scheme with help people drag bikes out of retirement</p>
					<p>up to half-a-million people drag bikes out of retirement</p>
					<p>speeding up the cycling revolution</p>
					<p>helping individuals become fitter</p>
					<p>fitter and healthier</p>
					<p>and reducing air pollution</p>
					<p>which remains a killer</p>
					<p>which remains a hidden killer</p>
					<br>
					<p>Clean air should be a priority</p>
					<p>Clean air should be as big a priority</p>
					<p>for us as clean water was to the Victorians</p>
					<p>Clean air should be as big a priority for us in the 21st century</p>
					<p>as clean water was to the Victorians in the 19th</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Closing remarks</strong></p>
					<p>The measures will help</p>
					<p>The measures discussed will help</p>
					<p>The measures discussed today will help</p>
					<p>...passengers use trains</p>
					<p>...more passengers use trains, buses and trams</p>
					<p>...more passengers use trains, buses and trams safely</p>

					<p>...And more people to benefit from infrastructure</p>
					<p>improvements in the Northern Powerhouse</p>
					<p>and across the country</p>
					<br>
					<p>They give us an opportunity</p>
					<p>They give us all an opportunity</p>
					<p>to harness the power of transport</p>
					<p>not just to return to lives</p>
					<p>in the world</p>
					<p>the post-COVID 19 world</p>
					<p>not just to help us return to the lives in the post-COVID 19 world</p>
